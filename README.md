# Android Resizer Toolkit

This tool lets you batch resize images with Photoshop CS5 and CS 6 for Android.

To compile the projects you will need Adobe Extension Builder 2.

Please note that, as [Adobe has dropped support for Flash on Photoshop](http://blogs.adobe.com/cssdk/2013/09/introducing-html5-extensions.html), this project is no more actively developed.
